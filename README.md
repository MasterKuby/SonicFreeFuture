# Collaborators/Branches
Don't worry about discord-RPC dll binary change, that's normal. When project is opened it changes then when closed it changes back.

When naming branches, use this scheme...

[branch type]/[stuff in branch]

So if the branch was for a spin attack, it'd be...

feature/combat-spin-attack

Or a bug...

bug-fix/floatation-device-uncontrolable

Branch Types:
- Feature
- Bug
- Enhancement

any more..?


Main branch is only for stable releases/builds, then dev branch is for merging feature, bug and enhancement branches into BEFORE merging into main branch.
